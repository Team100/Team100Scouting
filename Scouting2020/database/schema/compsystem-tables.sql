# Competition System Table Schema
#
# Notes:
#  - creates all tables for a new instance of the competition system
#
#  - if you modify a table, make _sure_ the modification is also made in this schema
#
#  - to execute, run mysql as:
#      mysql -D db-name -u user -p < scriptname
#
#  - document the purpose of a table by in the heading before the table
#
#  - a "drop table" script is maintained in compsystem-tables-drop.sql
#
#

#
# General schema notes
#  - Schema includes patterns from Blue Alliance API but does not adhere to its
#    structure or key system entirely
#  - Assumes that the system is refreshed yearly, but that team info persists.
#    This means:
#      - Fields that Blue Alliance can modify are tagged as such in the schema, 
#         with tBA (the Blue Alliance)
#      - The schema must work for multiple regional competitions and for nationals,
#         which looks like a collection of regional competitions.
#


#
# Event
# 
# Event ID, used to qualify data entry and use for a specific regional
#
# For nationals, we may have scouting for each of four fields.  Building in ability to clone
#  this app and use it in multiple places, then export and import those data into a master, or 
#  manage instances of the app and team, using the same event model.
