Competition System - Future Features


Note: not in priority sequence but kept here to capture potential features.

- customize 2020 game
   - work out hanging report: how to easily visualize?

- work out general y-to-y attributes, such as reliability.  Do they start as custom 
   params in db?  could help drive multi-value calcs

- Implement configurable calculations and averages
   - implement averages in match rapsheet

- work through ranking points formula vs. points and how to best capture.  A function?

- show numerical context for each measure (and configure in customization?)

- turn off practice data at somepoint?  Should we work on weighted average?
   better to turn off practice data entirely (at least for finals)?

- possibly rationalize all data-driven fields so that non-custom fields are represented 
   by same formatting methods?

- compare our match scoring with the match scores and report insconsistencies

- document customization model

- implement work pipeline so that new data can signal recompilation of summary fields.
    What is formula implementation model for these kinds of rollups.

- Use Entry Type to determine whether fields can be edited

- link up event entry app into customization model, complete with generators

- edit status indicator on matchteam screen, possibly using tooltips/javascript overlay.

- work through match compiled events vs. team information.  similar data on both. 
    which should be the default team screen?

- test data generator for system development and testing

- more examples of "compete as team" functions, how to build and use in model

- build out documentation system
