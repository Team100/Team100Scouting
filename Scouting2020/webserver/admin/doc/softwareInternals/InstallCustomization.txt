Install Customization Model
----------------------------

The install processes must accomodate the following requirements:
 - work on windows for single instance and linux for single and multi-instance
 - allow local htpasswd files
 - allow customized settings in paramaters file, but keep 
 - create fresh database or load from previous dataset
 
 
 Windows to Unix Conversion
 
 The BASH scripts written on windows have an additional ^M at the end of each
 line.  They won't run as such on unix. A converter converts all *.bash files
 and is driven by a directory of files relative to admin/utils.
 
 
 

Customization Methods

Two basic methods:
1. replace strings in general files.  This approach is used for params.inc, 
   as an example
2. direct the installation to an instance-specific file.  This approach is used
   in various places, including htpasswd.  It is also used to collect the 

Location of Customized Files
- Instance-specific files are kept in admin/instance-specific or database/instance-specific
- General forms of the same files may be kepts in various places, then customized to 
   instance-specific directories. */instance-general is a default location.
   
   Priority order of override is:
     - [multisite root]/sitedefs
     - instance-specific directory
     - instance-general directory
   
The linux scripts are designed to check if there is multi-instance info first, use that 
information, then use instance-specific files, and finally use the general files.
